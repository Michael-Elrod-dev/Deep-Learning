## Setup and Installation

There are two ways to set up the environment for this project:

### Option 1: Using the requirements.txt file

1. Ensure you have Anaconda installed on your system.
2. Create a new conda environment:

   conda create --name myenv

3. Activate the environment:

## Running the Program

This project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook. All of my outputs are saved and ready to view.
However you can recreate the outputs by running the program again.
To run it:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, install it:

   pip install jupyter

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   jupyter notebook

4. In the Jupyter interface that opens in your web browser, click on the notebook file (e.g., `project_name.ipynb`).

5. Once the notebook is open, you can run cells individually by selecting them and pressing Shift+Enter, or run all cells from the "Cell" menu by selecting "Run All".

6. Follow any instructions or comments within the notebook for specific operations or data handling.
